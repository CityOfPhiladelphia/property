# Server-side DOM implementation based on Mozilla's dom.js

[![Build Status][1]][2] [![dependency status][3]][4] [![dev dependency status][5]][6]

As the name might suggest, domino's goal is to provide a <b>DOM in No</b>de.

In contrast to the original [dom.js](https://github.com/andreasgal/dom.js) project, domino was not designed to run untrusted code. Hence it doesn't have to hide its internals behind a proxy facade which makes the code not only simpler, but also [more performant](https://github.com/fgnass/dombench).

Domino currently doesn't use any harmony features like proxies or WeakMaps and therefore also runs in older Node versions.

## Speed over Compliance

Domino is intended for _building_ pages rather than scraping them. Hence Domino doesn't execute scripts nor does it download external resources.

Also Domino doesn't implement any properties which have been deprecated in HTML5.

Domino sticks to the [DOM level 4](http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#interface-attr) working draft, which means that Attributes do not inherit the Node interface. Also [Element.attributes](http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#dom-element-attributes) returns a read-only array instead of a NamedNodeMap.

<b>Note that</b> because domino does not use proxies,
`Element.attributes` is not a true JavaScript array; it is an object
with a `length` property and an `item(n)` accessor method.  See
[github issue #27](https://github.com/fgnass/domino/issues/27) for
further discussion.

## CSS Selector Support

Domino provides support for `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` backed by the [Zest](https://github.com/chjj/zest) selector engine.

## Usage

```javascript
var domino = require('domino');

var window = domino.createWindow('<h1>Hello world</h1>');
var document = window.document;

var h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
console.log(h1.innerHTML);
```

## Tests

Domino includes test from the [W3C DOM Conformance Suites](http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/)
as well as tests from [HTML Working Group](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/Testing).

The tests can be run via `npm test` or directly though the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) command line:
